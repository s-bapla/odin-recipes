        <h2>This is a recipe for a smash burger</h2>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 soft hamburger roll, buttered and toasted</li>
            <li>Condiments and toppings as desired, such as mayonnaise, mustard, shredded lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and pickles</li>
            <li>4 ounces (110g) freshly ground beef chuck, divided into two 2-ounce (55g) balls</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 slice good melting cheese, such as American, cheddar, or homemade melting cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare burger bun by laying toppings on bottom half of bun.
                Have it nearby and ready for when your burger is cooked.</li>
            <li>Preheat a large stainless steel saut√© pan or skillet over high
                heat for 2 minutes. Place balls of beef in pan and smash down
                with a stiff metal spatula, using a second spatula to add pressure.
                Smashed patties should be slightly wider than burger bun</li>
            <li>Season generously with salt and pepper and allow to cook until
                patties are well browned and tops are beginning to turn pale pink/gray
                in spots, about 45 seconds. Using a bench scraper or the back side of a
                stiff metal spatula, carefully scrape patties from pan, making sure to get
                all of the browned bits.</li>
            <li>Flip patties and immediately place a slice of cheese over 1 patty, then stack
                the second directly on top. Immediately remove from pan and transfer to waiting
                burger bun. Serve.</li>
        </ol>
